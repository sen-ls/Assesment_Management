Finance Analysis Tools
Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python programs designed for financial analysis, including the calculation of portfolio variance, returns, the inverse of matrices, and analysis of assets under uncertainty. These tools leverage fundamental principles from finance theory, such as the Markowitz portfolio theory and CAPM, to provide insights into asset management and investment strategies.

Programs
1. Financial Metrics Calculator
This program calculates key financial metrics such as portfolio variance, returns, and more, offering a foundational tool for portfolio analysis.

2. Matrix Operations
A utility for performing mathematical operations on matrices, including calculating reciprocals and inverses, which are crucial for various financial models.

3. Expected Return Calculator
This tool computes the expected return of assets or portfolios, incorporating factors like asset correlation to aid in investment decision-making.

4. Markowitz Model Portfolio Optimizer
Leveraging the Markowitz model, this program optimizes a portfolio's asset allocation to achieve the best possible risk-return trade-off.

5. Asset Analysis under Uncertainty
Analyzes assets considering uncertain market conditions, providing insights into risk management and investment strategies.

Getting Started
To run these programs, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Most scripts are standalone and can be executed via a Python interpreter. Some programs may require NumPy for mathematical operations, which can be installed using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy
Running a Program
Navigate to the program's directory and run the Python script using:

bash
Copy code
python <program_name>.py
